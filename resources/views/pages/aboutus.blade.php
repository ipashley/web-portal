            <p>The Geological Survey was established in 1925 by the British Overseas Management Authority (BOMA) 
                administration under the name of Geological Survey Department (GSD) as an independent governmental
                 department. The primary objective was to speed up development of mineral resources of the Tanganyika Territory.
                  In April 1926, the headquarters of GSD was set up in Dodoma by the first director, Dr. E.O.Teale. The main assignment 
                  of the GSD was to provide geological information acquired through geological mapping and reconnaissance mineral 
                  exploration in the country as well as prospecting for groundwater resources. The Minerals Laboratory was established 
                  in 1929 to support the geological mapping and mineral exploration.</p>

                <p>In 2005 the Geological Survey was transformed into a Government executive agency established under the Executive
                     Agencies Act No 30 of 1997 and was officially launched as a Government Agency on 23 June 2006 under the name 
                     Geological Survey of Tanzania (GST).

                    In July 2017, the Government of Tanzania amended the Mining Act of 2010 through the 
                    Written Laws (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act, No. 7 of 2017. Through the amendment,
                     new functions were initiated on top of the other functions of GST described by the Mining Act 2010.
                      To capture the new/additional functions, the existing functions and organization structure of GST 
                      to was reviewed to enhance its capacity in order to deliver services efficiently and effectively.</p>
